# Google-Land-Mark-Recognition
In this Project we need to predict the name labels of landmarks given in the Google Landmark recognition picture dataset using Image analytics. The challenge at our hand is to build models that classify the images provided in such a way that it matches the correct landmark with each unique image. This image analytics technology can predict landmark labels directly from image pixels, to help people better understand and organize their photo collections. Similar projects take place every year such as the ILSVRC (ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge), but the biggest difference in this project is the larger number of classes. In this Project as part of the solutioning, we plan to use image analytics technology for image recognition by building various model architectures including Deep Learning models using Computer Vision with CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) that recognize the correct landmark (if any) in a dataset of challenging test images.
